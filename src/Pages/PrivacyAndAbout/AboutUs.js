                <p>Welcome to rego.live, your number one source for online shopping. We're dedicated to
                    giving you the very best of buying and selling, with an emphasis on user-friendly design, transparent policies,

                <p>Founded in 2023 by Jakop GÃ¸kpinar, rego.live has come a long way from its beginnings in
                    Kristiansand/Norway. When Jakop first started out, his passion for an easy shopping experience 
                    drove him to do tons of research so that rego.live can offer you a friendly product page for your growth. </p>
                <p>We now serve customers all over Norway, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion
                    into our own website.</p>

                <p>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any
                    questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
